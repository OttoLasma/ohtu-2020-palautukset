introductions of retrospective plans, and more specifically, introduction of start, stop, continue, more of, less of wheel and glad, sad, mad plans

1. Glad, Sad, Mad:

In this plan participants will list all the issues, changes, and observations they came across during the sprint and further categorize them as either sad, glad, or mad. After all participants have listed their observations, ones be should ranked from most important to least important. 
Then participants will discuss the topics until the meating is over.

2. Start, stop, continue, more of, less of wheel

In this plan the process goes as follows:
first, circle is drawn and further divided into five different categories having the topic of start, stop, continue, more of, and less of
Second, the following subjects will be dicussed: what we should begin doing? what is not productive and should be perhaps stoped? What processes should be continued? On what processes we should focus more and we should do less?
When commenting there is a need to identify on which topic this comment belong.
